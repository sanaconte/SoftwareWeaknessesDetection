abstract = {The Heartbleed vulnerability took the Internet by surprise in April 2014. The vulnerability, one of the most consequential since the advent of the commercial Internet, allowed attackers to remotely read protected memory from an estimated 24--55\% of popular HTTPS sites. In this work, we perform a comprehensive, measurement-based analysis of the vulnerability's impact, including (1) tracking the vulnerable population, (2) monitoring patching behavior over time, (3) assessing the impact on the HTTPS certificate ecosystem, and (4) exposing real attacks that attempted to exploit the bug. Furthermore, we conduct a large-scale vulnerability notification experiment involving 150,000 hosts and observe a nearly 50\% increase in patching by notified hosts. Drawing upon these analyses, we discuss what went well and what went poorly, in an effort to understand how the technical community can respond more effectively to such events in the future.},

abstract = { Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) is a method for flexible modelling of high dimensional data. The model takes the form of an expansion in product spline basis functions, where the number of basis functions as well as the parameters associated with each one (product degree and knot locations) are automatically determined by the data. This procedure is motivated by recursive partitioning (e.g. CART) and shares its ability to capture high order interactions. However, it has more power and flexibility to model relationships that are nearly additive or involve interactions in at most a few variables, and produces continuous models with continuous derivatives. In addition, the model can be represented in a form that separately identifies the additive contributions and those associated with different multivariable interactions.This paper summarizes the basic MARS algorithm, as well as extensions for binary response, categorical predictors, nested variables and missing values. It presents tips on interpreting the output of the standard FORTRAN implementation of MARS, and provides an example of MARS applied to a set of clinical data. }

@inproceedings{Harry_Zhang2004,
  abstract = {Naive Bayes is one of the most efficient and effective inductive learning
	algorithms for machine learning and data mining. Its competitive
	performance in classification is surprising, because the conditional
	independence assumption on which it is based, is rarely true in realworld
	applications. An open question is: what is the true reason for the
	surprisingly good performance of naive Bayes in classification? In
	this paper, we propose a novel explanation on the superb classification
	performance of naive Bayes. We show that, essentially, the dependence
	distribution; i.e., how the local dependence of a node distributes
	in each class, evenly or unevenly, and how the local dependencies
	of all nodes work together, consistently (supporting a certain classification)
	or inconsistently (canceling each other out), plays a crucial role.
	Therefore, no matter how strong the dependences among attributes
	are, naive Bayes can still be optimal if the dependences distribute
	evenly in classes, or if the dependences cancel each other out. We
	propose and prove a sufficient and necessary conditions for the optimality
	of naive Bayes. Further, we investigate the optimality of naive Bayes
	under the Gaussian distribution. We present and prove a sufficient
	condition for the optimality of naive Bayes, in which the dependence
	between attributes do exist. This provides evidence that dependence
	among attributes may cancel out each other. In addition, we explore
	when naive Bayes works well.},

Patients younger than 18 years, burn patients, coronary care patients, and cardiac surgery patients were excluded.Outcome Measure.—Vital status at hospital discharge.Results.—The SAPS II includes only 17 variables: 12 physiology variables, age, type of admission (scheduled surgical, unscheduled surgical, or medical), and three underlying disease variables (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, metastatic cancer, and hematologic malignancy). Goodness-of-fit tests indicated that the model performed well in the developmental sample and validated well in an independent sample of patients (P=.883 and P=.104 in the developmental and validation samples, respectively). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.88 in the developmental sample and 0.86 in the validation sample.Conclusion.—The SAPS II, based on a large international sample of patients, provides an estimate of the risk of death without having to specify a primary diagnosis. This is a starting point for future evaluation of the efficiency of intensive care units.(JAMA. 1993;270:2957-2963)}",

We assembled a dataset from the National Vulnerability Database and the SAMATE project, containing vulnerable PHP code samples and their patched versions in which the vulnerability is solved. We extracted features from the code samples by applying data-flow analysis techniques, including reaching definitions analysis, taint analysis, and reaching constants analysis. We used these features in machine learning to train various probabilistic classifiers. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we built a tool called WIRECAML, and compared our tool to other tools for vulnerability detection in PHP code. Our tool performed best for detecting both SQLi and XSS vulnerabilities. We also tried our approach on a number of open-source software applications, and found a previously unknown vulnerability in a photo-sharing web application.},

Writing Secure Code offers a ready cure. This fact-filled, eye-opening title covers the major aspects of creating secure applications through the entire development process, from secure design, to writing robust code that can easily withstand an attack, to testing applications for security vulnerabilities. Writing Secure Code provides software designers, architects, developers, and testers the training, theory, and techniques they need to ensure security. Topics covered include security principles, how to design, code, and test for security, how to write secure code for Microsoft® .NET APIs, why companies neglect security, the 10 immutable laws of security and security administration, and more. Developers who read this title will have the peace of mind that comes from knowing that the code they develop is not only fast, but secure. Both authors are top security experts at Microsoft who have helped solve some of the toughest security problems in the computing industry. No more malicious attacks! Learn the best practices for writing secure code, with samples in Microsoft Visual Basic®.NET, Visual C++®, Perl, and Visual C\#®. This is the first book that focuses on programming secure applications in general instead of covering security for just the Web developer, network administrator, or IT professional. Key Book Benefits: * Demonstrates the best practices for creating secure codethrough the entire development processfrom design to programming to testing * Includes code samples in Visual Basic .NET, Visual C++, Perl, and Visual C\#. * Focuses on programming secure applications in general instead of covering security for the Web developer, network administrator, or IT professional}

publisher = {Addison-Wesley Professional},
edition = {1st},
abstract = {A must-read for all Java developers. . . . Every developer has a responsibility to author code that is free of significant security vulnerabilities. This book provides realistic guidance to help Java developers implement desired functionality with security, reliability, and maintainability goals in mind. Mary Ann Davidson, Chief Security Officer, Oracle Corporation Organizations worldwide rely on Java code to perform mission-critical tasks, and therefore that code must be reliable, robust, fast, maintainable, and secure. Java Coding Guidelines brings together expert guidelines, recommendations, and code examples to help you meet these demands. Written by the same team that brought you The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java, this guide extends that previous works expert security advice to address many additional quality attributes. Youll find 75 guidelines, each presented consistently and intuitively. For each guideline, conformance requirements are specified; for most, noncompliant code examples and compliant solutions are also offered. The authors explain when to apply each guideline and provide references to even more detailed information. Reflecting pioneering research on Java security, Java Coding Guidelines offers updated techniques for protecting against both deliberate attacks and other unexpected events. Youll find best practices for improving code reliability and clarity, and a full chapter exposing common misunderstandings that lead to suboptimal code. With a Foreword by James A. Gosling, Father of the Java Programming Language}
