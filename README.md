# Software Weaknesses Detection


This is a work and master thesis for Software Weakness Detection, a system for vulnerability
detection based on Machine Learning applied to source code. The research purpose
is to relieve human experts from the time-consuming and subjective work of manually
defining features for vulnerability detection. 

The goal is to explore the use of static-code analysis hybridized with machine
learning techniques to detect critical software security vulnerabilities. The primary
emphasis of this research is on examining established static code analysis and machine
learning methods, along with their potential application scenarios

The system works on Java source code and can predict 2 different types of vulnerabilities
(Command Injection and Null Pointer Deferences). To create the basis for the
tool, a large dataset was derived from SAMATE projects and transformed according to
the model inputs. The data was transformed from several SAMATE projects examples
containing code snippets and for 2 different types of vulnerabilities.
